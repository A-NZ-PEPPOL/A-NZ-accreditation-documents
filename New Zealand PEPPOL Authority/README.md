# New Zealand Accreditation Process
All Service Providers must follow a simple 3 step process to be accredited by the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority.
This process is as follows:
1) Complete the [Expression of Interest form](https://mbie.wufoo.com/forms/k1exqioh1dk6euw/)
2) Complete this accreditation pack
3) Complete testing requirements

The time required to complete this process is dependent on the readiness of the individual Service Provider seeking accreditation.

## New Zealand based Service Providers

This review will determine the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority’s confidence in accrediting you to use the PEPPOL eDelivery network.
This process includes an in-depth review of your organisation including:

1. financial position
2. insurance policies
3. leadership credibility, and
4. online presence

You will also need to provide information about your organisation’s technical infrastructure and security processes.


## Established Service Providers
If your organisation is already operating on the PEPPOL network, we will engage with your domain’s local PEPPOL Authority to determine your eligibility for New Zealand accreditation.

You will still need to complete some sections of the accreditation pack and complete New Zealand interoperability testing.

## Australian accredited Service Providers
PEPPOL Service Providers accredited by the Australian PEPPOL Authority are also eligible for mutual accreditation by the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority, and will only be required to sign the New Zealand Annex 5.

# What’s involved in the accreditation process?
## Join OpenPEPPOL
OpenPEPPOL membership is mandatory for all Service Providers who intend to offer AP and/or SMP services within the PEPPOL network. Prior to applying for OpenPEPPOL membership, please ensure you are fully aware of your responsibilities as a New Zealand PEPPOL Service Provider by reviewing the requirements outlined on the [OpenPEPPOL website](https://peppol.eu/get-involved/join-openpeppol/) and within the Annex documents provided in the accreditation pack.

## Complete an Expression of Interest
Your organisation can express their interest in becoming a New Zealand accredited Service Provider by completing our online [Expression of Interest form](https://mbie.wufoo.com/forms/k1exqioh1dk6euw/). In lodging this form, you formally begin the accreditation process.

## Complete the accreditation pack
The accreditation pack is contained in a .ZIP download.

You will need to complete and return this documentation, as well as any other information required to support your application.

Once you have completed all the documentation, please ZIP up your pack and email it to the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority.

**Subject:** *Organisation name* - completed accreditation pack

Please avoid submitting incomplete packs, as this will delay the accreditation process.

### Keys

**New SP** = Service Providers that are not yet accredited with any PEPPOL Authority

**Australian Accredited SP** = Any Service Provider that has received accreditation in Australia. This may include Australian based or international service providers.

**Established SP** = Service Providers accredited with another PEPPOL authority (but not Australia)

## Testing Requirements

There are 3 stages of testing required to complete the accreditation process:

1. Using the test network for unit testing in your own environment
2. OpenPEPPOL testbed (Access Point Provider only)
3. Interoperability testing

## Collecting your Test PKI certificate

You will receive instructions on how to obtain your Test PKI Certificate when you become a member of OpenPEPPOL. This certificate allows you to operate on the test network, and will enable you to complete the required interoperability testing.

**Be sure to download your test certificate within ten days.** Certificates not downloaded within this timeframe will expire and you will need to raise a request with OpenPEPPOL to have the certificate renewed.

## OpenPEPPOL Acceptance Testing (Access Point Providers only)

Once you have completed unit testing in your own environment you can commence acceptance testing in the OpenPEPPOL central test bed. This formally tests your access point’s compliance with the PEPPOL eDelivery Network specifications.

Successful completion of acceptance testing is a pre-requisite for interoperability testing.

Acceptance testing is completed with the Test PKI Certificate and involves:

1) verification of the Service Provider’s certificates (both the PEPPOL and Security (TLS) certificate)
2) validation of the Service Provider’s ability to send/receive business documents to/from the Test Access Point
3) generation of an acknowledgment for the documents sent.

Upon completion of acceptance testing, you must provide your results to OpenPEPPOL for verification. OpenPEPPOL will notify the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority once successful acceptance testing is complete.
Please note that currently there is no testbed for SMP acceptance testing.

## Interoperability testing

The New Zealand PEPPOL Authority will facilitate an Interoperability Test with an existing PEPPOL Access Point provider. This is to confirm the Service Provider:

1) is able to establish compatibility with another Australian or New Zealand PEPPOL Access Point
2) conforms with local BIS requirements.

To complete interoperable testing, you will be provided with a set of test files which your access point will need to process to identify which files are valid, and which are invalid.

If you are ready for interoperability testing and require testing files, please contact us at [support@nzpeppol.govt.nz](mailto:support@nzpeppol.govt.nz).

## Confirming Accreditation as a New Zealand Service Provider

Once all required accreditation documentation and activities have been successfully completed, the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority will confirm accreditation has been granted and add your organisation to the register of accredited Service Providers on the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority website.

You will then receive your signed agreement, and a PDF certificate confirming your accreditation with the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority. You will also be provided with a digital badge to identify your organisation as a New Zealand accredited Service Provider on your website.

## Collecting your Production PKI Certificate

Once accredited, you can request your Production PKI Certificate. The Production PKI Certificate allows you to begin transacting within the PEPPOL network.

The Production PKI Certificate is requested via the [OpenPEPPOL Jira Service Desk portal](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) by selecting ‘PKI Certificate Request’ and completing the certificate request form.

OpenPEPPOL will review your request and verify your OpenPEPPOL membership status. If any membership fees are outstanding, you will be asked to pay these before the request will be processed. OpenPEPPOL will then assign the production certificate request to the New Zealand PEPPOL Authority for final approval.

You will be notified by email once your PKI certificate has been granted. Be sure to download your test certificates within ten days. Certificates not downloaded within this timeframe will expire and you will need to raise a request with OpenPEPPOL to have the certificate renewed.
